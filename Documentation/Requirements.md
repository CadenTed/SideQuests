# Deliverable 2 - Project Requirements

## 1. Positioning
### 1.1: Problem Statement
The problem of disorganization and cluttered schedules affects college students and professors alike; the impact of which is a stressful existence and forgetting to complete important tasks throughout any given day.

### 1.2: Product Position Statement
For people working or studying at a college who have busy schedules, SideQuests is a calender/planner website that turns organization and productivity into a rewarding activity; unlike Google Calender our product offers a rewards system to encourage the user to complete their tasks every day.

### 1.3: Value proposition
SideQuests is an easy to use website that assists in navigating the chaos of life with reminders and rewards, praising you for staying on track.

## 2. Stakeholders
**Users/Testers - NAU students**

NAU students and users that test our software will provide input on what the project is missing and how it may be improved. It is best to get a third-party view of what is missing from the website being developed for better insight on what is desired from the product. 

**Competitors - Online Planners (Google Calendar)**

Online planners are not an uncommon thing, especially to college students as our audience. We will present our product as something different than our competitors, such as Google Calendar, as we offer more incentive to finish the userâ€™s tasks.

**Application Developers - Project Team**

As the developers, we are constantly changing and improving our product and are able to test it and run through what specifications are missing or lacking in the project. 

**Community - NAU**

Having an effective planner will aid in having school work turned in on time, or even earlier, which helps professors, in our case NAU faculty, in keeping students on track and ready for class. This could also apply to jobs outside of regular school work, for example NAU offers work for the school, such as tutoring or grading for a class, which would be more effective with employees getting grades in a timely manner or being prepared for tutoring sessions.
