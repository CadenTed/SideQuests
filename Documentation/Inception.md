# Deliverable 1 - Project Inception

## 1. Introduction

Every modern college student and working professional has hundreds of tasks to keep track of and complete each month. To stay productive and motivated, one must have a way of organizing these tasks that is simple, concise, and fun to use. Having to switch between different apps or tabs to access one's calendar, to-do list, and notes - or worse, having to flip through pages of a physical planner - is time consuming and anything but enjoyable. SideQuests is an online personal and academic planner that is easy to use, takes up little digital space, and promotes productivity and motivation through rewards.
