## 5. Code Quality

As a team, we kept our code quality neat and readable by organizing by section for the webpage and using descriptive variables to be able to understand each other's code. As our website has different pages, it was necessary to keep the same coding conventions for each page to have a cohesive website. For example, every page has different sections displaying varying subjects, in which we coded using the same manner of separating these components, such as div classes for organization. In addition, we used comments to set apart the portions we worked on or separate ideas in general to be able to read what we each contributed and to reread the each code file with ease. Our comments were written ourselves to provide human descriptions that are easy for us to comprehend, rather than automated comments. As for variables and functions, our functions are named literally on what they do so that there is no confusion and variables have simple yet specific enough names to make it easy to differentiate. If numbers are used for variables, they are used in such a manner that they are necessary and are still readable, given the context of the code. Overall, we kept simple, but descriptive, naming conventions and ensured that our code could be read and understood through comments, especially for others in the group that did not write the code.
