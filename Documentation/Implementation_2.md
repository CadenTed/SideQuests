# Deliverable 6 - Second Implementation

## 1. Introduction

SideQuests is an easy to use website that assists in navigating the chaos of life with reminders and rewards, praising you for staying on track. The main features of this product are being able to track your progress and get rewarded for completing tasks. Users have the option of listing tasks and the date that they need to be completed by. Users can also collaborate with their friends on tasks, and see their friends status's. As of right now, the features implemented are as follows. 

There is a calendar on the webpage that shows the current month and highlights the current day. There is a to-do list that users can add tasks to. They are able to specify the date the task should be completed by, as well as the priority that the task has. The user is able to sort the list by due date or by priority. They can also delete the tasks off of the list without completing them. There is also a counter that tracks the number of points a user has earned and display them on the same page as the todo list. The points earned are based on the priority of tasks completed. It also tracks the number of tasks completed. There are pages for the friends list, and the trophies that have been earned. There is also an initial login page. It uses a database to store and access user information.

## 5. Code Quality

As a team, we kept our code quality neat and readable by organizing by section for the webpage and using descriptive variables to be able to understand each other's code. As our website has different pages, it was necessary to keep the same coding conventions for each page to have a cohesive website. For example, every page has different sections displaying varying subjects, in which we coded using the same manner of separating these components, such as div classes for organization. In addition, we used comments to set apart the portions we worked on or separate ideas in general to be able to read what we each contributed and to reread the each code file with ease. Our comments were written ourselves to provide human descriptions that are easy for us to comprehend, rather than automated comments. As for variables and functions, our functions are named literally on what they do so that there is no confusion and variables have simple yet specific enough names to make it easy to differentiate. If numbers are used for variables, they are used in such a manner that they are necessary and are still readable, given the context of the code. Overall, we kept simple, but descriptive, naming conventions and ensured that our code could be read and understood through comments, especially for others in the group that did not write the code.
