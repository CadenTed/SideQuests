## 3. Tests

## 4. Adopted Technologies
**Visual Studio Code:**

As a group, we decided to use the same code editor, in which Visual Studio Code is a code editor that allows for building and debugging code. We decided that VSCode would be the best for building our code as we can test pages for the website with ease. In addtion, using the same code editor ensures cohesion while we create code individually.

**JS 2 Calendar:**

The goal of SideQuests is to provide a fun and free planner that keeps students organized with college life, meaning that a calendar is needed to be implemented. As the group is using JavaScript, the best decision for the current version of the website is to use a JavaScript implementation of a calendar. The calendar shows accurate months and days for the current year, as well as having a button to display the current date.

**Hostwinds:**

The format of SideQuests is a website, in which needs a server to be accessible by anyone utilizing it. The group decided on using Hostwinds as it is a web hosting service that we are all familiar with. Hostwinds only relies on itself instead of a third party to provide the server we need, which makes it a simple website host for SideQuests.

**Piksel:**

SideQuests utilizes a rewards system to encourage users to stay on track and earn more points. To better visualize this, sprites for each reward are being made as trophies. Piksel is a free online sprite editor that is very useful to make images for each reward with complete creative freedom.

**Summary:**

SideQuests is a functional demo currently, with a working to do list and functioning calendar, and is accessible to the public. Although a lot of the key functions of the website are yet to be finished, SideQuests is on the right track with the basics of the website implemented and the group has a better insight of what the website will become.

## 5. Learning/Training

The group decided on first splitting up the group in six sections to cover the most ground in terms of implementation, including the research. For our first version of the website, there was not a whole lot of research needed, but the points that were needed serve as key roles of the website. The most important part of the current version of SideQuests that needed to be researched was the calendar. Some suggestions were thrown out in case a calendar could not be implemented, such as creating our own calendar, however it would not work in the long term. Luckily, JavaScript has its own calendar implementation, which works well with how we are implementing the website itself. Despite this, the JavaScript calendar does not have a day-by-day view that allows users to see when tasks are due at specific times. The group settled on implementing the JavaScript calendar for the first version and to add a more complicated one later down the road.

Another part that needed to be researched was the log in page, which needs to safe information on the username and password and remember any information from the client's information. However, the most applicable option for our website is being shut down in the current month, pushing back the availability of the log in page. Despite this, some other options that may be looked into include GitHub and Facebook login software, which will be a bit lower as a prioriy as more research will be conducted on adding tasks and events in the calendar of SideQuests.

As our project continues, there will likely be more research, such as on a more proper calendar implementation with timestamps, login software, and connecting with other friends with accounts and being able to share information stored within profiles.

## 9. Look and Feel

We wanted our site to have a dark mode theme and be similar in aesthetic to the Github or Discord's dark mode. Our background colors include dark gray, navy blue, and black, while the text and highlights are in white and light blue. The dark color scheme helps the awards stand out. For the awards - and eventually for our main logo - we decided to go with a 16-bit, pixelated art style. This art and the name of the software are reminiscent of older videogames. These style choices give the idea that checking things off your to-do list is like a game, encouraging productivity and completion of important real-life tasks.
