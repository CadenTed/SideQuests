## 9. Look and Feel

We wanted our site to have a dark mode theme and be similar in aesthetic to the Github or Discord's dark mode. Our background colors include dark gray, navy blue, and black, while the text and highlights are in white and light blue. The dark color scheme helps the awards stand out. For the awards - and eventually for our main logo - we decided to go with a 16-bit, pixelated art style. This art and the name of the software are reminiscent of older videogames. These style choices give the idea that checking things off your to-do list is like a game, encouraging productivity and completion of important real-life tasks.
