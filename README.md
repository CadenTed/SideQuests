# SideQuests

SideQuests is a website that allows users to keep track of tasks with a todo list. Completion of these tasks will produce experience points and stickers depending on the task. The experience points will allow the user to level up, which they can compare their level and stats with friends to incentivize completion of tasks.

## Status

---

SideQuests is currently in the early stages of implementation and deployment. In this version users have the ability to add and remove tasks, view a basic calendar, view a template friends page, update profile information, and view template rewards.

Access to the website can be found [here](http://www.sidequests.pro/).

## Development tools

---

SideQuests uses HostWinds Web Hosting for our website server.

Code will be done in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
